    pains:
      - OTIF dips around seasonal peaks and late cut-offs
      - Split consignments and missed trunk connections
      - Limited overflow storage near North hubs
      - Slow POD visibility and fragile claims
    outcomes:
      - >95% OTIF via network + direct trunk blend
      - Overflow storage + x-dock within 30â€“60 mins of M62 corridor
      - Photo-on-scan POD + live portal updates
      - Lower trunk miles and fewer splits via smart routing
